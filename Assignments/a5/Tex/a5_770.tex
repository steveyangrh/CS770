Note: this function only works with odd number of sampling points, for question 2, we have only tested it on odd number of sapling points.\\
\section{Exercise 2}
\subsection{Exercise 2a}
$f(x)=x$, When n = 101\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{e211.jpg}\\
As we can see here, there is oscillation near the discontinuity of the function.
\subsection{Exercise 2b}
$f(x)=exp(cos(2\pi x))$, When n = 21\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{e221.jpg}\\
We have a good approximation here.
\subsection{Exercise 2c}
$f(x)=((x-0.5)/0.5)^{2}$, When n = 21\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{e231.jpg}\\
As we can see here, the approximation here is not as good as (b), the reason is that although the function is continuous, however it's not differentiable at boundary points. Therefore 
\subsection{Exercise 2d}
$f(x)=((x-0.5)/0.5)^{m}$, For this question we set n to be 21\\
When m = 5:\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{e241.jpg}\\
When m = 10:\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{e242.jpg}\\
When m = 25:\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{e243.jpg}\\
When m = 50:\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{e244.jpg}\\
When m is odd, function f is an odd function on the interval, therefore, f is non-differentiable and discontinuous. Compared to an even m, the Fourier approximation is worse for odd functions.\\\\
Moreover, when m increases, the function at boundary points become steeper and steeper, the absolute value of the derivatives becomes higher and higher, function becomes less and less differentiable. Therefore, as m increases, the Fourier approximation becomes worse and worse.

\section{Exercise 3}
For Fourier series,\\\\
\centerline{$a_{k}$ = $2\int_{0}^{1}f(x)cos(2\pi k x)dx$, $b_{k}$ = $2\int_{0}^{1}f(x)sin(2\pi k x)dx$}
\subsection{Exercise 3a}
For $f(x)=(cos(8\pi x))^{4}$, \\\\
\centerline{$a_{k}$ = $2\int_{0}^{1}(cos(8\pi x))^{4}cos(2\pi k x)dx$, $b_{k}$ = $2\int_{0}^{1}(cos(8\pi x))^{4}sin(2\pi k x)dx$}\\\\
\centerline{Since $cos(2x) = 2cos(x)^{2}-1$}\\\\
\centerline{Then $cos(8\pi x)^{4}$ = $\frac{1}{4}(\frac{cos(32\pi x)}{2}+2cos(16\pi x)+1)$}\\\\
By the orthogonality property,\\\\
\centerline{$a_{0} = \frac{3}{8}$, $a_{8} = \frac{1}{2}$, $a_{16} = \frac{1}{8}$, All $b_{k}$ is 0}\\\\
Then the continuous Fourier series is\\\\
\centerline{$f(x)$ = $\frac{3}{8} + \frac{1}{2}cos(16\pi x)+\frac{1}{8}cos(32\pi x)$}\\\\
For discrete Fourier coefficients, when n = 5:\\\\
\centerline{$a_{0} = C_{0}$}\\\\
when n = 11:\\\\
\centerline{$a_{0} = C_{0},$}\\\\
when n = 21:\\\\
\centerline{$a_{0} = C_{0}, a_{8} = 2\times Real(C_{8})$}\\\\
We expect $a_{k} = 2\times Real(C_{k}), b_{k} = 2\times Imag(C_{k})$ up to n/2, and all other $C_{k}$s to have 0 real parts and 0 imaginary parts. However, this is not the case when we don't have enough sampling points. The coefficients of some high frequency terms also show up in the $C_{k}s$, this is because of aliasing. For example, when n = 11.\\\\
\centerline{$C_{5} = 0.0625$}\\\\
 -$2\times C_{5}$ equals the coefficient of $cos(32\pi x)$. If we compared between $cos(32\pi x)$ and $cos(10\pi x)$, they give the same values at the sampling points. Similar phenomenons also show up when n equals other values.
\subsection{Exercise 3b}
For $f(x)=x$,\\\\
%\centerline{$C_{k}$ = $\int_{0}^{1}xe^{-2\pi i k x}$}\\\\
%\centerline{Let $u = x, \frac{dv}{dx} = e^{-2\pi i k x}$}\\\\
%\centerline{Then $du = 1, v = \frac{1}{-2\pi i k}e^{-2\pi i k x}$}\\\\
%\centerline{Then $\int xe^{-2\pi i k x}$  = $\frac{x}{-2\pi i k}e^{-2\pi i k x}-\int \frac{1}{-2\pi i k}e^{-2\pi i k x}$}\\\\
%\centerline{$\int xe^{-2\pi i k x}$ = $\frac{x}{-2\pi i k}e^{-2\pi i k x}-\frac{1}{-4\pi^{2}k^2}e^{-2\pi i k x}$}\\\\
%\centerline{Since $C_{k}$ = $\int_{0}^{1}xe^{-2\pi i k x}$}\\\\
%\centerline{Then $C_{k}$ = $(\frac{1}{-2\pi i k}e^{-2\pi i k}-\frac{1}{-4\pi^{2}k^2}e^{-2\pi i k}) - (0 - \frac{1}{-4\pi^{2}k^2})$}\\\\
%\centerline{$C_{k}$ = $\frac{â€¢}{-4\pi^{2}k^2}$}\\\\
\centerline{$a_{k}$ = $2\int_{0}^{1}xcos(2\pi k x)dx$, $b_{k}$ = $2\int_{0}^{1}xsin(2\pi k x)dx$}\\\\
Let's compute $a_{k}$ first,\\\\
\centerline{Let $u = x$, $\frac{dv}{dx} = cos(2\pi k x)dx$}\\\\
Then\\\\
\centerline{$\frac{du}{dx} = 1$, $v = \frac{1}{2\pi k}sin(2\pi k x)$}\\\\
Then\\\\
\centerline{$\int xcos(2\pi k x)dx$ = $\frac{x}{2\pi k}sin(2\pi k x)$ - $\int \frac{1}{2\pi k}sin(2\pi k x)$}\\\\
\centerline{$\int xcos(2\pi k x)dx$ = $\frac{x}{2\pi k}sin(2\pi k x)$ + $ \frac{1}{(2\pi k)^{2}}cos(2\pi k x)$}\\\\
\centerline{$a_k$= $2\int_{0}^{1}xcos(2\pi k x)dx$ = $0$}\\\\
For $b_{k}$\\\\
\centerline{$\int xsin(2\pi k x)dx$ = $\frac{1}{4\pi^2 k^2}sin(2\pi k x) - \frac{x}{2\pi k}cos(2\pi k x)$}\\\\
Then\\\\
\centerline{$b_{k}$ = $-\frac{1}{\pi k}$}\\\\
And $a_{0}$ is just $\int_{0}^{1}x = \frac{1}{2}$, then\\\\
\centerline{$f(x)$ = $\frac{1}{2}+\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}(-\frac{1}{\pi k})sin(2\pi k x)$}\\\\
For discrete Fourier coefficients, similar to question 3a, $a_{0}\approx \frac{1}{2}$, and $b_{k}\approx -2\times Imag(c_{k})$ up to $k = \frac{n}{2}$.
When choosing 11 sampling points, the difference between $b_{k}$ and $-2\times Imag(c_{k})$ is\\ 
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{e321.png}
When choosing 101 sampling points, the difference between $b_{k}$ and $-2\times Imag(c_{k})$ is\\ 
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{e322.png}
When choosing 1001 sampling points, the difference between $b_{k}$ and $-2\times Imag(c_{k})$ is\\ 
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{e323.png}\\
As we can see here, the difference decrease really fast as we have more and more sampling points.
\section{Exercise 4}
%When the function is periodic on $[a,b]$ instead of being periodic on the interval of $[0,1]$\\\\
%\centerline{Let $I = b-a$, then $C_{k} = \sum_{0}^{n-1}f(x_{n})e^{-2\pi i \frac{k}{I}x_{n}}$}\\\\
%When approximating the original function, we have \\\\
%\centerline{$f(x)$ = $\frac{a_{0}}{2}+\sum_{0}^{n-1}2Real(C_{k})cos(\frac{2\pi}{I}kx)-2Imag(C_{k})sin(\frac{2\pi}{I}kx)$}\\\\
%For example,\\\\
%\centerline{Let $f(x) = x-5$ on interval $[5,10]$}\\\\
Here we introduce a mapping from interval [0,1] to [a,b]\\\\
\centerline{$t = (b-a)x+a$, where $x$ $\in$ [0,1], t $\in$ [a,b]}\\\\
Let's call this mapping t(x), and the inverse mapping x(t). \\\\
\centerline{$x = \frac{t-a}{b-a}$}\\\\
We use the points on [0,1] when calculating the coefficients,\\\\ 
\centerline{Then $C_{k} = \sum_{0}^{n-1}f(t_{n})e^{-2\pi i k x(t_{n})}$}\\\\
When approximating the original function, we have\\\\
\centerline{$f(x) = \frac{a_{0}}{2}+\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}a_{k}cos(2\pi k x(t))+b_{k}sin(2\pi k x(t))$}\\\\
For example, let f(x) = x, we set the interval to be [2,9], when having 101 sampling the points, the graph is the following:\\\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{e41.jpg}
\section{Exercise 5}
Let's take $f(x) = x^{\frac{3}{2}}$ as an example, this function is 1 time differentiable, the reason is the following, for its second derivative $f''(x) = \frac{3}{4}x^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ , it doesn't exist at x=0. Following this pattern, we can find a series of k times differentiable functions. For example, functions that have the form\\\\
\centerline{$f(x) = Cx^{\frac{1}{2}+k}$, where C is a constant}\\\\
are k times differentiable.\\\\
Take $f(x) =x^{\frac{1}{2}+2}$ which is a 2 times differentiable function, the error is plotted in the following graph:\\\\
